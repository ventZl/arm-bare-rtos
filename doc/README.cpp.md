Use of C++20-based implementation of nano RTOS
==============================================

To use pure C++20 version of the code, you need the following files:

 * src/kernel/kernel.cpp
 * src/kernel/arm_arch.h

Kernel is provided as C++ module, so there is no separate header. Naturally
you need recent-enough compiler that supports C++ modules.
